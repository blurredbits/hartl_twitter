# Ruby on Rails: Hartl Tutorial Part II

Post Dev Bootcamp do-over of Hartl's Twitter App.

Couple of reasons:

1. As this was pre-acceptance work - just seeing how much more of it makes sense.
2. Following @theotherzach's advice regarding doing this over-and-over until
it becomes ingrained in my blurry little head.
3. $$$$ (maybe - someday)

So, giving credit where credit is due:
